    "- F1-Score: is essentially a combination of these two.\n",
    "In cases where we want to find an optimal blend of precision and recall, we can combine the two metrics using what is known as the F one score. And the F one score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, taking both metrics into account. The reason we use the harmonic mean instead of just a simple mean or simple average is because it's going to punish extreme values."
